# Lab 3 – Individual Worksheet: V-Model and Traceability

> **Course:** CS G523 – Software for Embedded Systems  
> **Student Name:** Aditya Ashok Pise  
> **Project:** Angle of Attack (AoA) Controller for Aircraft Stall Protection  
> **Team:** AoA Controller Group  

---

## Objective

This worksheet captures **individual reasoning** about how selected system requirements are:
- realized through **runtime interactions** (sequence diagrams),
- verified through **explicit test artifacts**.

This document is an **individual exploratory artifact** and complements
the finalized **group Lab 2 submission**.

---

## 1. Selected Requirements

The following two requirements are selected from the finalized group submission
as they are **safety-critical** and exercise both **normal** and **exceptional** system behavior.

| Requirement ID | Requirement (brief description) |
|----------------|---------------------------------|
| R-A3 | The system shall compute a valid AoA using 3-sensor voting and reject a faulty sensor |
| R-F3 | The system shall automatically override pilot/autopilot control during a confirmed stall |

---

## 2. Sequence Diagram(s)

Separate sequence diagrams are used, as the selected requirements represent
**distinct operational phases** of the system.

---

### Sequence Diagram A (for R-A3: Sensor Voting and AoA Validation)

This diagram captures **normal operation with fault tolerance**, showing
how the AoA Controller processes multiple sensor inputs before producing a valid AoA output.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant AoA_S1 as AoA Sensor 1
    participant AoA_S2 as AoA Sensor 2
    participant AoA_S3 as AoA Sensor 3
    participant Controller as AoA Controller
    participant PilotAP as Pilot / Autopilot
    participant Display

    AoA_S1-->>Controller: AoA value S1
    AoA_S2-->>Controller: AoA value S2
    AoA_S3-->>Controller: AoA value S3

    Controller->>Controller: Compute pairwise differences
    Controller->>Controller: Identify outlier sensor
    Controller->>Controller: Reject faulty sensor
    Controller->>Controller: Compute final AoA using remaining sensors

    Controller->>PilotAP: Valid AoA (Normal)
    Controller->>Display: Green / Normal indication
```

### Sequence Diagram B (for R-2) (if required)

```mermaid

    participant Actor2 as Actor
    participant System as System
    participant SensorOrActuator as SensorOrActuator

    Actor2->>System: Event / Command
    System->>SensorOrActuator: Action
    SensorOrActuator-->>System: Feedback
```

---

## 3. Test Artifacts

For **each requirement**, define **one test artifact**.

### Test for Requirement R-1
- **Setup:**  
- **Procedure:**  
- **Pass criteria:**  

### Test for Requirement R-2
- **Setup:**  
- **Procedure:**  
- **Pass criteria:**

## Reflection (Optional)

Briefly note any ambiguity or difficulty in mapping requirement → interaction → test.
